# reseqtrack

This codebase supports the Resequencing Informatics sub team from Vertebrate Genomes at EMBL-EBI.

This provides the infrastructure to track files and metadata to provide data coordination services for high throughput genomics and epigenomics projects.

Resequencing Informatics published a description of the data coordination for the 1000 Genomes Project in Nature Methods in 2012.
